        <p id = "vaccination">As at 22 May 2022, almost one billion people in lower-income countries remain unvaccinated. Only 57 countries have vaccinated 70% of their population – almost all of them high-income countries.

We must continue to support all countries to reach 70% vaccination coverage as soon as possible, including 100% of those aged over 60; 100% of health workers; and 100% of those with underlying conditions.

Vaccine supply has improved, but absorption has not kept pace. In some countries, we see insufficient political commitment to roll out vaccines. This was impacted by the initial lack of political commitment for equitable access to vaccines. In some, we see gaps in operational or financial capacity. And in all, we see vaccine hesitancy driven by misinformation and disinformation.

WHO’s primary focus now is to support countries to turn vaccines into vaccinations as fast as possible.

We must ensure fair and equitable access to vaccines, and ensure every country receives them and can roll them out to protect their people, starting with the most vulnerable.

See WHO’s landscape of COVID-19 vaccine candidates for the latest information on vaccines in clinical and pre-clinical development.
WHO’s COVID-19 dashboard also features the number of vaccine doses administered globally, with more detail provided on the dedicated COVID-19 vaccination dashboard.
At a regional level, there is an AFRO COVID-19 vaccines dashboard and a PAHO COVID-19 vaccines deliveries dashboard.
