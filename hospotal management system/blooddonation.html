    <br>
    <br>
  <p>  Blood donation is one of the most significant contribution that a person can make towards the society. It is not harmful for an adult person to donate blood. The body of the donor can regenerate the blood within few days. It poses no threat to the metabolism of the body.

With this thought IMI Bhubaneswar organized blood donation camp on 16th of Feb in campus in association with "AAMA Odisha" and “Red Cross”. It began at around 10 am and continued up to 2 pm, with a steady stream of donors throughout. The camp saw enthusiastic participation by students and faculty. The first floor of activity building was abuzz. All students were chatting with each other in the waiting room, happy to be able to play their part in lending a helping hand to people in the region. One of the rooms was utilized for a thorough medical check-up of potential donors, as well as the donation itself, while another there was another hall was where donors could lie down and recuperate for a while before they leave venue. After donation they were provided with refreshments such as fruit juice, biscuits, a banana and a chocolate. The blood samples were carefully collected, sealed and transported away.

Throughout the day, there were smiles and laughter all around - a true embodiment of what we believe in - selfless service with a smile. The donors received certificate of recognition. They also got a credit card where one unit of blood is available free from Government. Thus, IMI Bhubaneswar came up for a great cause and successfully conducted the blood donation camp</p>
